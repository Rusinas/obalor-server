            Addiction is a disease that continues to cost the global community a staggering amount, both financially and in lives lost.
            Despite these consequences, patients with substance use disorders (SUD) often do not receive the treatment they need. Treatment barriers include stigma around substance use, inadequate medical training, skepticism about medications and treatment, and lack of clinician confidence in treating patients with addiction.
            On this ExpertTrack, you’ll learn evidence-based treatments to help you overcome these barriers and provide better care for your patients.
            You’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of providing patient-centred treatment which has been shown to increase survival and recovery of patients with addiction.
